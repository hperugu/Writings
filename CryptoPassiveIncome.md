There are umpteen number of way to earn the money in Crypto world. I am going to enumaerate those in this series.
The first method I tried my hand was Staking.
Staking can be daunting but there are mutiple ways in how a crypto currency can be staked.

* I chose the most easy one in this TIME staking

* Next, the standard staking of Coins that have good future potential.  Solana is one of those. they provide Airdrop coins. I am more interested in Chain Staking.

* Another way is collecting Air Drop Coins and HODL (or holding) or selling or staking.

* Locking your coins in a Crypto Bank and receiving around 8% APY

* Day trading of Crypto currencies -- This market is very volatile. 

* Crypto investment using HODL strategy or trading bots. They can be lucrative

* Mining the coins using our own servers, these are usually expensive in terms of energy and cost. But these can be good passive income ideas.

* Flash loan is another option of active income. but thsi needs some deep knowledge in the blockchain technology.
