There is a new sheriff in town--ESG. Nobody knows what he is capable of -but every on eacknowledges him. This is not the first time  environment, cliamte change , or sustianability -- the different incarnations  of   chimera  aka good samartian  appeared in teh corporate sector. This time it came as acronym of its friends-- which do not exactly belong to them but differnet persepctivaes of the same good deeds. 

Unfortunately, ESG creates a feeling that it belongs to non-profit orgnization than for-profit business orgnizations. Because a lot of pressure from different stakeholders and governmental agencies, corporate leaders are forceflly turning their heads towards this sign.

If you want to learn more about this topic --there are hardly any structured courses available. especially the environemnatl pactioners who want to change from NPO/government sectors to business org izations or the dat an;aysts wh are motivated to apply their skills for society--there is no single program focused for them .Since I could not find any for this specific purpose. I tried create one for myself. Firstly -- I assume I would imagine the aspirnats might have some expertise on either of those.  if you have environemnetal background -that is the best. Becasue that exactly matches with my profile. You must start learning a data processing language like Python-- no, only Python.

Axctually for ESG data is used or collected from different sources ao one must ahve good understanding of data bases and querying the data via SQL. Then process that data  to clean  and curated datasets. identifying key performace indicators (KPI) related ESG starting from  GHG metrics, Lifecycle analysis, sustainability indices, societal particpation information, gernance issues/quants etc. using these metrics we should be able to generate some scenarios. 

For example, if x expense is increased for increasing prodcutivity by y -- how would overall score of ESG increase. Establishing these kind of relationships could help to create models. Using the extensive data overall actionable startagies can be identified. 

There are different frameworks for ESG implemenation at any orgnization.
